# Working code for Discrete Optimization course on Coursera

This is undoubedly one of the toughest courses I have ever taken. 
The assignment problems get tougher, you will need to switch the solution strategy depending on the size of input data for the same assignnment,
so you will see that I use different solvers in the course of the same assignment.
